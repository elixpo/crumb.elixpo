# Input namespaces and connector catalog

Crumb keeps prompting natural: a user writes a normal sentence without `?`,
`@`, or another activation prefix. The deterministic router keeps known shell
commands native and sends eligible natural-language requests to the agent.

## `/` — Crumb actions

`/` opens Crumb's command palette. Slash commands are handled locally and are
never interpreted as prompts or passed to the native shell accidentally.

### Keep now

- `/auth login|status|logout`
- `/history` and `/history search <text>`
- `/platform`
- `/version`
- `/shell`
- `/exit`

### Add with the agent UI

- `/help` — searchable command and shortcut help
- `/mode auto|negotiate|plan` — change agent autonomy
- `/model` — inspect or select a model route
- `/effort` — inspect or set reasoning effort
- `/session list|inspect|resume|search|rename|archive|restore|export|delete` — manage redacted agent sessions
- `/context` — show the context budget and attached references
- `/attach` and `/detach` — manage files, folders, or connector resources
- `/connectors` — list, connect, inspect, or revoke integrations
- `/skills` and `/plugins` — discover, enable, disable, and inspect capabilities
- `/tools` — show available tools and their risk classes
- `/permissions` — inspect or change user-granted policy
- `/memory` — inspect, edit, or clear user-approved memory
- `/config` — inspect and safely patch live configuration
- `/cancel` — cancel the active agent turn and its child processes
- `/doctor` — diagnose Harness, provider, connector, and optimizer health
- `/cost` — show session token and provider usage when available

The command palette may insert a typed `@` reference. For example,
`/attach` can produce `@file:README.md`, while `/connectors use github` can
produce `@connector:github`.

## `@` — inline context references

`@` identifies context inside an otherwise normal request. It is not an agent
activation prefix and does nothing without a surrounding command or prompt.

- `@file:<path>` — one local file
- `@folder:<path>` — a bounded directory view
- `@selection` — the current terminal or editor selection
- `@clipboard` — clipboard content after explicit user confirmation
- `@last-error` — the previous native command's bounded diagnostics
- `@diff` — the current repository diff
- `@session:<id>` — an existing Crumb session
- `@skill:<id>` — a discovered skill
- `@plugin:<id>` — an installed plugin capability
- `@connector:<id>` — a connected external service

References resolve deterministically before model input. Missing, ambiguous,
oversized, or unauthorized references fail visibly. Referencing a connector
does not grant permission to use it.

## Connector rollout

### Available foundation

- **Pollinations** — text, image, video, audio, transcription, embeddings, and
  3D generation through the user's connected account.

### Priority 1

- **GitHub** — repositories, code search, issues, pull requests, releases, and
  Actions; writes require per-operation approval.
- **Google Drive** — find, read, create, and organize user-selected files.
- **Cloudinary** — upload, transform, search, and manage generated media.
- **Gmail** and **Outlook Email** — search and draft first; sending always
  requires explicit confirmation.
- **Google Calendar** and **Outlook Calendar** — read availability and propose
  events; creating, changing, or deleting events requires confirmation.

### Priority 2

- **GitLab** — repositories, merge requests, issues, and pipelines.
- **Slack** and **Microsoft Teams** — search and summarize; posting requires
  confirmation.
- **Notion** — search, read, create, and update approved pages/databases.
- **Linear**, **Jira**, and **Confluence** — issue and project workflows.
- **OneDrive**, **SharePoint**, and **Dropbox** — document storage and sharing.
- **Amazon S3** and **Cloudflare R2** — scoped object storage for project and
  generated-media workflows.

### Priority 3

- **Discord** — community search, summaries, and confirmed posting.
- **Figma** — inspect design context and export approved assets.
- **Google Contacts** and **Microsoft People** — contact lookup with narrow
  scopes and no silent modification.
- **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite** — schema-aware, read-only by default;
  mutations require an isolated approval path.
- **Cloudflare**, **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure** — diagnostics first;
  infrastructure changes require explicit plans and approvals.

## Connector requirements

Every connector must provide:

- OAuth or delegated authorization through Accounts Elixpo; no pasted secrets
  when a safe account flow exists.
- Least-privilege scopes, read-only defaults, capability discovery, and clear
  reauthorization when scopes change.
- Per-action risk classification and user approval outside the model.
- Revocation, account-deletion cleanup, token rotation, and visible connection
  health.
- Bounded, redacted outputs; credentials never enter prompts, memories,
  journals, terminal history, or logs.
- A replaceable MCP or native adapter so provider details do not leak into the
  shell core.
